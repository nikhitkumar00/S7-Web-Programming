<!-- A palindrome is a number or a text phrase that reads the same backward
and forward. For example, each of the following five-digit integers
is a palindrome: 12321,55555, 45554 and 11611. Write a script that
reads in a five-digit integer and determines whether it's a palindrome.
If the number is not five digits long, display an alert dialog indicating
the problem to the user Allow the user to enter a new value after
dismissing the alert dialog. Give code in javascript -->
